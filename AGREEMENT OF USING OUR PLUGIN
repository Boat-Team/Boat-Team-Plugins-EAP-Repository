# MINECRAFT PLUGIN USE END USER LICENSE AGREEMENT
As you know, you have successfully reached a certain degree of cooperation with Boat Team. In order to protect our Minecraft: Java Edition plug-in in game, we have formulated this End User License Agreement, hereinafter referred to as EULA. Like you, we don't like reading long license texts, so we will finish it as soon as possible.

### USE OUR PLUGIN
You have been licensed to use the Minecraft plug-in we made, so you can use it on your own device. Now we will give you limited rights to do other things, but we must draw a demarcation line to prevent people from crossing the boundary. If you want to create content related to any content we have created, we are honored, but please ensure that it will not be interpreted as official content, and that it complies with this EULA and the Brand and Asset Use Guide. Most importantly, do not use any content we have created for commercial purposes.

If you violate any of the terms of this EULA, we can revoke the license and permission that authorize you to use our plugin.

When you enter into cooperation with us, you will receive a license, which will grant you the right to use the plug-in made by us on your own personal/team device/server, and to use the plug-in on the device according to the provisions of this EULA. This permission only applies to you or your team, so you and your team cannot distribute the plug-in (or any part of it, such as a class file, etc.) to anyone else. It also means that you cannot make it accessible to others, and you cannot transfer or resell any use rights. Please help us prevent piracy and fraud and protect our plug-ins, which is very important. We must also prevent our community members from buying pirated versions of our product's license keys, which we can cancel.

### OWNERSHIP OF OUR PLUGINS AND OTHER CONTENT
Although we grant you permission to install and use our plug-in on the device, we are still the owner of the plug-in. Therefore, when you cooperate with us, you actually get the license to use our plug-in according to this EULA, not the plug-in itself. The only permissions you have related to plug-ins and plug-in installation are those specified in this EULA.

Any attached/auxiliary plug-ins you create for our plug-ins from scratch belong to you (including pre run plug-ins and in memory plug-ins), and you can perform any required operations on them as long as you don't make money by selling them/try to make money from them, and don't distribute our plug-in versions. Remember, any attached/auxiliary plug-ins you create for our plug-ins are your original works and do not contain the substantial part of our code or content. You only own the content you created, not our code or content.

### RESPONSIBILITIES AND JURISDICTIONAL RESPONSIBILITIES
The terms in this EULA do not affect any legal (statutory) rights that you may have in relation to our plug-ins according to law. You may have certain rights that cannot be exempted by the laws applicable to you. None of these provisions will affect those legal rights, even if they may conflict with your legal rights. This is what we mean when we say "according to the applicable law".

According to applicable laws, when you obtain a copy of our plug-in, we provide it "as is". Updates are also provided "as is". This means that we do not promise you anything about the standards or quality of our games, nor do we promise that our plug-ins will not be interrupted or contain errors. We are not responsible for any loss or damage that the plug-in may cause. We may privately release a snapshot/beta version before the plug-in is completed, so they may (and often will) contain bugs, but we prefer to release these features in advance rather than let you wait for it to be perfect. If you want to inform us of a potential bug, we have a special channel for partners.

### GENERAL PROVISIONS
Your local laws may give you rights that cannot be changed by this EULA; If so, this EULA will apply to the extent permitted by law. Nothing in this license will limit our liability for death or personal injury caused by our negligence or fraudulent misrepresentation.

We may change this EULA from time to time if there are appropriate reasons, such as changing our plug-ins or legal obligations. However, these changes will only take effect to the extent permitted by law. If you use updates or some parts of the plug-ins you use rely on our continuous online services, the new EULA will apply. In the latter case, we will notify you before the change takes effect by sending an email to your mailbox. Although we will try our best to be fair in this regard, sometimes the law will change, or someone will do something that affects other users of the plugin, so we need to prohibit this behavior.

If you give us a suggestion about any of our plug-ins, it is free of charge, and we have no obligation to accept or consider it. This means that we can use or not use your suggestions in any way we need, without paying you.



### The final interpretation right of this EULA is only BiliBiliBaiye_CN owns
