# Boat Team Plugins EAP Repository
The offical repository of Boat Team's Early Access Project

### Warning:
the EAP version isn't the final product, it may contains a lot of bug. Welcome for feeding back issues !

### Common Informations
If you downloaded the EAP version's plugin, that's the same as you downloaded the GA version, that still means you accept our license, for more details, check the license file.

the EAP edition is the preview of the GA edition, the features in EAP are less than the normal GA (Unless you downloaded the latest jar file in the repository), and it also may contains a lot of bugs. But our developers will not stop here,we will keeps on developing on a same product, untill the problem is solved.

However, but we follows the life-cycle rule, and if we want to, we also can announce the product is unsupported, since then, we will upload all the source code of the plugin to Github, and public for download. But it needs 1 of the 2 reqirements:
(a) we don't want keeps developing it.
(b) the normal GA's support date is over
Otherwised we won't unsupport any plugin easilly.

We remain all the latest build of EAP version's plugins. But if the corresponding project of it is over (the plugin is unsupported), we will list it in "legacy", and you still can download it, you can find them in another repository, but you cannot get any support of this product. The reason is we won't pay time on an unsupported project. If you want a project come back, please feedback an issue in the legacy repository.
